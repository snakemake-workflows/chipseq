# description: "The strand-shift cross-correlation is a quality control metric.
# The plot is generated for each sample using run_spp.R script from
# <a href='https://github.com/kundajelab/phantompeakqualtools' target='_blank'>phantompeakqualtools</a>.
# It computes the Pearsons's linear correlation between the minus and plus strand for each shift value after shifting minus strand by k base pairs.
# Usually the plot shows two peaks: a maximal cross-correlation peak and a \"phantom\" peak corresponding to the read length.
# These peaks are used to calculate the relative and the normalized strand cross-correlation coefficients.
# For more information about calculation and interpretation of this values please see
