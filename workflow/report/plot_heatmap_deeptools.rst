**deepTools `plotHeatmap <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/plotHeatmap.html>`_** creates a
heatmap for scores over sets of genomic regions and gives a visualisation for the genome-wide enrichment of the samples.
The `scores <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/computeMatrix.html>`_ represent the signal over a
set of regions where all regions are scaled to the same size.
