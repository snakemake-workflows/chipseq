**MACS2 FRiP score** is generated by calculating the fraction of all mapped reads that fall into the `MACS2 <https://github.com/taoliu/MACS>`_ called {{snakemake.config["params"]["peak-analysis"]}} peak regions.
A read must overlap a peak by at least 20% to be counted to `FRiP score <https://www.encodeproject.org/data-standards/terms/>`_.
