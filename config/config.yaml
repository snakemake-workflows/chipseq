# one row per sample. It can be parsed easily via pandas.

params:
  # these cutadapt parameters need to contain the required flag(s) for
  # the type of adapter(s) to trim, i.e.:
  # * https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#adapter-types
  #   * `-a` for 3' adapter in the forward reads
  #   * `-g` for 5' adapter in the forward reads
  #   * `-b` for adapters anywhere in the forward reads
  # also, separate capitalised letter flags are required for adapters in
  # the reverse reads of paired end sequencing:
  # * https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guide.html#trimming-paired-end-reads

   # reasoning behind parameters:
  #   * `-e 0.005`: the default cutadapt maximum error rate of `0.2` is far too high, for Illumina
  #     data the error rate is more in the range of `0.005` and setting it accordingly should avoid
  #     false positive adapter matches
  #   * `--minimum-overlap 7`: the cutadapt default minimum overlap of `5` did trimming on the level
  #     of expected adapter matches by chance
