# description: "The normalized strand cross-correlation coefficient is a quality control metric based on strand-shift cross-correlation plot.
# The barplot is generated using run_spp.R script from
# <a href='https://github.com/kundajelab/phantompeakqualtools' target='_blank'>phantompeakqualtools</a> and shows for each sample on y-axis the
# normalized strand cross-correlation coefficient on x-axis.
# The coefficient is defined by the ratio of maximal cross-correlation value divided by the background cross-correlation.
# The higher NSC values are the better the enrichment.
# For more information about calculation and interpretation of this value please see
# <a href='https://hbctraining.github.io/In-depth-NGS-Data-Analysis-Course/sessionV/lessons/CC_metrics_extra.html' target='_blank'>Quality Metrics Based on Cross-Correlation</a>."
