**`Homer annotatePeaks <http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/ngs/annotation.html>`_ ** is used to annotate the peaks relative
to known genomic features. The plots of this analysis show for all samples and their associated controls peak location
relative to annotation, percentage of unique genes to closest peak an peak distribution relative to TSS
(Transcription Start Site).
