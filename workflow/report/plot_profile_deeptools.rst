**deepTools `plotProfile <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/plotProfile.html>`_** creates a
profile plot for scores over sets of genomic regions and gives a visualisation for the genome-wide enrichment of the
samples. The `scores <https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/en/develop/content/tools/computeMatrix.html>`_ represent the
signal over a set of regions where all regions are scaled to the same size.
